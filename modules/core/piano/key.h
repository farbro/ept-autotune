/// \brief Class describing a single piano key
///
/// This class holds all information related to an individual piano key
/// of the keyboard. The most important element is the logarithmically binned
/// power spectrum of the key (in short: logbin spectrum). In contrast to the
/// ordinary FFT, which is linear in the frequency index, the logbin spectrum
/// is a vector whose index is logarithmic in the frequency. The resolution
/// is chosen in such a way that each vector component corresponds exactly
/// to one cent (1/100 half tone).
///
/// In addition, the Key class comprises various member variables such as the
/// mesured, the computed, and the tuned frequency.
